    <title>Welcome to Vanessa's Website</title>

<body>
    My name is Vanessa Doutherd. I live in a quiet area in Sacramento, California where I was born and raised.

    I have always been passionate about learning and education. I attended Sacramento State University in 2014. There, I
    earned a Bachelor's degree in English and a Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language. Currently, I am
    working toward an Education Specialist degree at the University of Missouri -Columbia. My major is in Learning
    Design and Technology with a certification in User Experience and Usability.

    I have worked in adult learning for more than 6 years. I have enjoyed many great opportunities including being an
    Instructor, Instructional Design Specialist, and Program Developer. I truly love developing courses for students and
    designing with instructors and businesses. I feel my best when I am creating experiences that inspire people to feel
    confident in their learning.

    I have a moderate background in web development and design. I started both hobbies in 2018 and have really enjoyed my self-study journey. They are still my
    most entertaining hobbies, and I try to practice regularly. I find it useful to revisit the basics often. My expectation for this course is that it will provide a well structured review of the basics of 
    foundational and stylistic web development. Eventually, I want to use these skills in Front End Web Development, UX/UI, or Instructional Design jobs.
