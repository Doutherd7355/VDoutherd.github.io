        <h3>Welcome to Technology Leadership in TESOL. A technology leadership and knowledge resource for adult ESL
            instructors.</h3>
        <p>As technology changes, the implementation of new modes of digital learning and information gathering in the
            classroom change as well. The purpose of this website is to educate instructors in the TESOL field about how
            to advance as technology leaders in the adult education classroom. <br><br>

            This resource aims to grant TESOL educators the power and insight to integrate technology into adult English
            learning contexts. Users of this resource will become familiar with the connection between adult
            education in TESOL and sociotechnical and sociocultural definitions. They will also characterize what
            meaningful technology integration is and what it looks like in sociotechnical ESL contexts. Finally, users
            of
            this resourse will analyze example scenarios of technology use in adult ESL classrooms and evaluate whether
            they are meaningful or not.
