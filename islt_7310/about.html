    <p>My name is Vanessa Doutherd. I live in a quiet city in Sacramento, California where I was born and raised.

        I have always been passionate about learning and education. I attended Sacramento State University in 2014.
        There, I earned a Bachelor's degree in English and a Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language.
        Currently, I am working toward an Education Specialist degree at the University of Missouri -Columbia. My major
        is in Learning Design and Technology with a certification in User Experience and Usability.

        I have worked in adult learning for more than 6 years. I have enjoyed many great opportunities including being
        an Instructor, Instructional Design Specialist, and Program Developer. I have worked in adult learning for more
