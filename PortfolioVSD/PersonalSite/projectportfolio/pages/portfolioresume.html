          <div class="about-me-content col-6">

            <p>One of my most deeply held values in life is that my work should not only help people, but it should also
              inspire those who interact with it to feel more confident, comfortable, and excited about what they are
              doing.
              For close to a decade, I have worked to transform this value into some of the greatest passions of my
              life.
              <br><br>

              As a dedicated Instructor and Instructional Designer, I have learned that every person and system needs
              help
              with
              something at some point, but the way they need help is always unique and centered around who/what they
              are,
              now and what they are trying to achieve both short-term and long-term. <br> <br>
          </div>
          <div class="about-me-content col-6">
            <p> The lessons I have learned studying as UX/UI Designer and Front End Developer have not been much
              different
              from my work in education. I am constantly reminded that (thankfully) learning never ends. Users are
              meaningful and important. There is no shortage of ways to successfully reach those you choose to serve,
              and
              research is crucial! <br> <br>

              In the future, I hope to use any combination of my passions to make a difference for companies and
              individuals
              who care about making a difference themselves. </p>
