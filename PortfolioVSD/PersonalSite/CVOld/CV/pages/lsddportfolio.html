                    After a lot of hard work and many walked roads, I can proudly say that I remain a driven educator after 5 years of experience teaching a variety of students in academic and cultural education.
                    As a leader who manages and guides learning experiences for students and peers both on and offline, I know the importance of excellent interpersonal and collaborative skills in a successful learning and teaching environment.
                    <br><br>
                    I chose the Learning Systems Design and Development Specialist degree because I wanted to further integrate technology into my teaching. My long-term goal is to work the in the Language Learning field as an Instructional Designer
                    or eLearning Developer.

                          <p> <strong>Summary</strong> : This artifact is a 2 day workshop that three other students and I are developing and designing for the course, Instructional Systems Design. The artifact is a creation of a two day workshop
                            for K-12 educators for using Skype and Virtual Reality in the classroom. Due to this class being taken at the same time as portfolio submission, this artifact is not in its complete stage; however, there are sections
                            completed that show
                            demonstration of this competency. This is a group project, whereas each member has responsibilities shown in the timeline and distribution of work chart.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Learning Process</strong>: Four students in Instructional Systems Design collaborated to complete the design of a two day workshop for K-12 educators in using Skype and Virtual Reality in their teaching. Because
                            I use Google
                            Expeditions and Google Cardboard in my own teaching, I was considered the VR SME for this workshop. Another student was the SME for Virtual Reality. The other two students helped with learner analysis, summative
                            evaluation, and data collection tools. Due to time constraints in the class, some work is theoretical and did not require actual data collection, but included plans for data collection and collection techniques. The
                            workshop was created using the ADDIE/backward design model. This model allowed us to work in a linear fashion and complete the steps for Instructional Design so that we began with the end in mind for what we wanted our
                            learners to know.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>My Role</strong>: For this project, I assumed the position of SME for virtual reality. I wrote the Big Ideas and Goals for the VR side of the workshop. Secondly, I created the survey for the Needs Analysis. The
                            survey would be
                            sent electronically to all participants a week before the workshop takes place to give the instructors time to analyze the data and determine if any changes in the instructional plan needed to be made based on survey
                            results.
                            A second data collection tool used would be phone interviews. Because the workshop included teachers from kindergarten all way to twelfth grade, needs would be individualized based on the age of the students.

                            The next large part of the artifact that was solely my responsibility was the creation of the Task Analysis for the Virtual Reality part of the workshop. Beneath each goal was a step by step task for the participants to
                            complete. Visual cues were included when necessary. This will allow each participant clear objectives as if no one in the group has any prior experience in the area of virtual reality.

                            At this point in the semester, other members are completing their sections of the workshop. I do have more responsibilities, but per the timeline, they are not due to be completed at this time.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Reflection</strong>: As this was my last class in the program, it was a way for me to culminate everything I have learned in the LSDD program and use the acquired skills to develop a detailed workshop for
                            educators to using new
                            technologies, Virtual Reality and Skype, with their students to increase student engagement and learning. We had a team that worked very well together on this workshop. One student was the team leader who sent out weekly
                            check ins to the group. Communication was always open among members using the Canvas message tool and email. We drafted our individual sections of the project using Google Docs and allowed other members to make edits
                            and/or comments to the document for suggestion revisions. The division of labor for this workshop made the tasks manageable. We did need to adjust our schedule as Spring break travel put us a few days behind. The team
                            member added buffer days for this specific reason. It was great to collaborate with others on this project. Three of us are educators and one of us works in corporate instructional design world. We each added to the
                            project in a meaningful way, and also each of us provided assistance to others when clarification was needed. This workshop dealt with two different learning technologies and two of us were considered SMEs in the areas
                            of Skype and Virtual Reality. Since we had SMEs in the group, the other group members had easy access to individuals of expertise. I also appreciated using the ADDIE model, but also will use other ID design models taught
                            in
                            class depending on the need. This workshop made me realize how important it is to write clear objectives and to add how they will be measured. I use virtual reality in my classroom and I am excited to use the workshop
                            being developed for Skype with my students also. In the future, I would like to move into a district technology facilitator position. Workshops like these are something I would love to create and teach someday.
