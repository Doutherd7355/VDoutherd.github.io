    <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
    <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
    <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
    <p>On our first day, we started by visiting Montmartre right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking la Seine.</p>

    <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
    <p>On our second day, we went shopping on Avenue des Champs Elysees. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.

      <br><br>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to Notre Dame. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited le Louvre.</p>

    <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
    <p>The picture below is of me visiting the Arc de Triomphe. It's huge! We also went to le Musee D'Orsay. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many
      sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
